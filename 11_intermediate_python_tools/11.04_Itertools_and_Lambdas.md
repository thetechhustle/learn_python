# 11.04_Itertools and Lambdas

The python library **itertools** is like a gift that keeps on giving. Some Python enthusiasts even would call it Python's secret weapon! Let's break it down. 😎

## Why Itertools? 🤔

***Itertools*** is a module provided by Python that consists of efficient functions inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML. It is an incredibly useful toolbox for handling iterators (sequence of items). This module works as a lifesaver when it comes to memory usage for large data. It also significantly reduces the time in running complex for loops.

Let's look at an example.

```python
import itertools

iterable1 = "ABC"
iterable2 = "123"

result = itertools.chain(iterable1, iterable2)

for item in result:
    print(item)
```

When you run this piece of code, you'll get a following output sequence: `A B C 1 2 3`. Merging two iterators has never been this easy!

## Hello, Lambda Functions! 👋

A **lambda** function is a small, anonymous function which is defined with the lambda keyword, instead of the usual def keyword. They are great for constructing adaptable functions on the go.

Lambda functions can have several arguments but express just one expression. They are handy when you need a quick function to do short tasks.

```python
add_ten = lambda x: x+10
print(add_ten(5))
```

```python
multiply = lambda x,y: x*y
print(multiply(3,4))
```

When you run these pieces of code, you'll get `15` and `12` respectively. Voila! You just wrote a function in one line. 🎉

## A Symphony of Itertools and Lambdas 🎼

Pairing itertools with lambda functions creates an efficient and powerful tool. Let's see an example.

```python
import itertools

numbers = [10, 20, 30]

result = itertools.accumulate(numbers, lambda x, y: x+y)
for item in result:
    print(item)
```

When you run this piece of code, this will print a running total of `10 30 60`. It's like adding numbers in motion! 😮

## Wrapping Up 🎀

Itertools, with its variety of functions, takes your Python iteration skills to the next level. Similarily, Lambda functions help keep your code cleaner and sleek, with short, compact functions. When these two are paired together, your Python code becomes so much leaner and efficient.

Keep practicing these tools, and you'll soon find yourself integrating them in your regular Python coding with ease. Keep that "Beautiful is better than ugly" principle in mind, and remember - once you master itertools and lambda functions, consider yourself a notch higher in your Python prowess! 👊
