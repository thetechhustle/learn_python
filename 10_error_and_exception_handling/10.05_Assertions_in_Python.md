## 10.05 Assertions in Python

As our program grows and becomes more complex, bugs may naturally start to creep in. Assertions in Python are a handy tool to catch these bugs early in the development cycle. An assertion is a sanity-check, a way to avoid future error in the code. In Python, we can use the `assert` keyword to start an assertion statement.

In simple terms, it let’s your program assert that a certain condition is met. If this condition turns out to be True, then that’s excellent! The program can continue. If the condition turns out to be False, you can have the program throw an AssertionError exception. 👾

### Using `assert` in Python:

Here's an illustrative example:

```python
def apply_discount(product, discount):
    price = int(product['price'] * (1.0 - discount))
    assert 0 <= price <= product['price'], "Discount can't exceed the original price!"
    return price
```

In this function, the assertion verifies that the discounted price is neither higher than the original price nor below zero. The function will throw an AssertionError exception if, for any reason, this is not the case.

### The Power of Assertion in Debugging Development 🔍

Many professionals embrace the use of assertions during the debugging and development process. If an assertion fails, it is a clear signal that there is a flaw in the code. Assertions can catch inappropriate values that may result in a fault, making them invaluable in maintaining code quality.

But remember, assertions are not meant to replace proper error handling. They are a mechanism to catch unlikely mistakes that, if uncontrolled, could lead to serious program crashes.

### Practice Makes Perfect 💪

Try your hand at using assertions in Python in your little projects. The more you familiarize yourself with it, the more you feel comfortable using it in larger, more complex applications. Just like an artist, you need to practice simple strokes before executing a masterpiece.

### Wrapping Up ⌛

In this section, we learned about the use of assertions in Python as a mechanism for error detection in the early stages of code development. The power of assertion can help you maintain code quality and prevent likely crashes, making it an indispensable tool in your developer arsenal.

Remember that learning to code is a journey, and mistakes are part of the process. However, with tools like assertions, we can always ensure our code runs as expected, despite unexpected errors and exceptions.

Until next time, Happy Coding! 💻.
