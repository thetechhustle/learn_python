## 15.02 Mock Coding Challenges

Welcome to the arena of Mock Coding Challenges! 🎯🛠️

Think of it as a stage, where you’ll rehearse your grand performance before the big day. These challenges provide an opportunity to apply what you've learned in a simulated interview environment. So, don't hold back; go in full swing.

### Why Mock Coding Challenges? 🤔

Mock coding challenges are an essential part of your interview preparation. Here's why:

1. 💪 **Flex your programming muscles:** It will help reinforce your Python learning, as you apply your theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems. 
2. 🕹️ **Test under real-world scenarios:** The challenges are designed to mimic actual interview questions, giving you a firsthand taste of what to expect. 
3. 📝 **Learn to code under time constraints:** More often than not, interview challenges are timed. Mock challenges provide the perfect platform to improve your speed and accuracy.

### Tools for Practising Mock Challenges ⚙️

There are countless resources online where you can find mock coding challenges. Here are a few of our favourites:

- **HackerRank:** A platform that provides a multitude of coding challenges across various domains, from algorithms to artificial intelligence.
- **LeetCode:** Here, you'll find a vast collection of interview questions from leading tech companies. The timing feature keeps you aware of your pace.
- **CodeSignal:** This is a platform for coders at all levels, offering an engaging way to hone your Python skills through gamified coding tasks.
- **Exercism:** Exercism focuses on enhancing your problem-solving skills via peer-reviewed exercises. 

The key here is consistent practice. It's not about how many mock challenges you attempt, but about genuinely understanding each problem and learning the efficient way to solve it.

### Example Challenge 🧐

Let's look at a common example of a mock coding challenge:

```python
# Problem: Given an array of integers, return indices of
# the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

def two_sum(nums, target):
    # This solution uses a dictionary to store and check for values
    dict_nums = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        remaining = target - num 
        if remaining in dict_nums:
            return [dict_nums[remaining], i]
        dict_nums[num] = i  
    return None

# Test the function
print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # -> [0, 1]
```
Don't fret if you feel overwhelmed at first. The key to solving these problems lies in understanding the problem clearly, thinking through potential solutions logically, and breaking it down into simpler tasks.

### Conclusion - Embrace the Challenges 🚀

Mock coding challenges offer you the best way to ensure you're at your most ready on D-day. Embrace these challenges. Make mistakes, learn from them, and keep moving forward. With every challenge you solve, you're one step closer to conquering your interview. Happy coding! 🎉
