🪄 ### Kick Start with Python's Built-in Functions

Python comes with an impressive array of built-in functions that perform a plethora of tasks. By knowing these, you can save yourself the effort of reinventing the proverbial wheel. We are going to introduce some of the most commonly used built-in functions in Python. Buckle in, and let's begin!

🕹️ **print(): The Magic of Revealing Secrets**

`print()` is the most basic and widely used built-in Python function. It takes in an object or several objects as arguments and writes them to the output device (usually your console).

```python
print("Hello, Wizard!")
print("Your quest for Python Mastery begins now!", end = " 👀")
```

💼 **len(): The Potion of Size Perception**

One of the most versatile built-in functions in Python, `len()` finds the length (the number of items) of an object. This function works on strings, lists, tuples, and other builtin iterable objects.

```python
vessel_of_knowledge = ["variables", "datatypes", "lists", "tuples", "dictionary", "sets"]
print(len(vessel_of_knowledge))
```

💡 **type(): The Enchanting Eye**

For the beginner wizard, it's common to lose track of what kind of data we're working with. Python's `type()` function helps identify the datatype of any object.

```python
value = "Python's magic is enchanting!"
print(type(value))
```

🔄 **range(): The Conjuror's Loop**

When conjuring loops, `range()` is your best friend. It generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (also by default), and stops before a specified number.

```python
for value in range(5):
    print(value, "likewise no. from 0 to 4")
```

🎲 **random(): The Dice of Destiny**

Python's random module contains a multitude of functions, but the `random()` function is used to generate a random number between 0 and 1. It's like rolling a magical dice with infinite sides!

```python
import random
print(random.random())
```

⏳ **Understanding and utilising Python's built-in functions is a crucial waypoint on your journey to mastery.** Each function carries an essential piece of magic that simplifies your code and keeps it clean and readable.

Remember, a masterful wizard is not one who uses the most complicated spells, but one who knows when to use the right spell at the right time! 🌟-P.
