📜 **06.01 Defining a Function** 📜

In the realm of Python, functions are the pillars that uphold the structure of your spellbook (code). Defining a function is like weaving a magical incantation, ready to be invoked when required. Let's conjure our first spell in Python!

Python functions are defined using the keyword `def`, followed by a function name, the spell's name if you will. Inside the brackets, you can specify any number of parameters (we'll cover these in detail in the next section). The function definition ends with a colon (`:`), and the code within the function is indented by four spaces. 

Here's our first spell:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, Wizard!")
```
In this magic incantation (function), `greet` is, of course, the name of our spell, and the `print("Hello, Wizard!")` is the action our spell will perform. To call this function, we merely need to invoke its name:

```python
greet()
# Output: Hello, Wizard!
```
In a single incantation, Python greets our wizard. Powerful, isn't it! Now you might wonder, why the spellbook? Why not cast spells directly? 

Well, my fellow conjurer, defining functions allows us to avoid repeating code. Let's say we want to greet our wizard multiple times throughout our adventure. Without a function, we'd be stuck writing the same `print` statement every time. But with our `greet` spell, our code becomes more readable and efficient. That's the power of Python functions! 

🔮 **Multiple Spells, Multiple Actions** 🔮

One spellbook can contain many spells, and in Python, one script can contain multiple functions. So, don't shy away from defining as many functions as needed. For example, we can have a separate spell to wish our wizard good luck:

```python
def wish_good_luck():
    print("Good luck on your quest!")
    
wish_good_luck()
# Output: Good luck on your quest!
```
Remember, every function is a tool that brings us one step closer to being a master spell-weaver!

In our upcoming sections, you will learn more about fine-tuning these spells (functions) — how to pass secret messages (parameters) to shape their outcomes and divine unseen insights (return values) to make your Python journey truly magical! Until then, keep practicing and exploring the art of defining functions. 🧙‍♀️🔮✨
