## 08.04 Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python that enables a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This effectively broadens your toolset and enhances code reusability, flexibility, and customization.

### Understanding Multiple Inheritance

Consider this an advanced feature in Python's treasure trove, and it works in a pretty straightforward way. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```python
class Parent1:
    def function1(self):
        print("This is function 1")

class Parent2:
    def function2(self):
        print("This is function 2")

class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
    def function3(self):
        print("This is function 3")

obj = Child()
obj.function1()
obj.function2()
obj.function3()
```
In this scenario, the `Child` class is able to call upon methods from both `Parent1` and `Parent2`, illustrating the basic usage of multiple inheritance. Function 1 and Function 2 are carried over from the parent classes to the child class üéâ.

While this example we've just discussed is quite simple, multiple inheritance can get complex when the same method is present in more than one parent class, more so when one parent class inherits from another. Here, the concept of the Method Resolution Order (MRO) comes into play, which we'll cover in subsequent sections.

### Reshaping your applications

To understand how multi-inheritance could reshape your application, consider a scenario where you‚Äôre building an application for a zoo. For this, you create base classes like `Mammal`, `Bird`, `Aquatic`, etc., each with specific behavior and attributes.

```python
class Mammal:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_warm_blooded = True
        self.category = "Mammal"

class Aquatic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.can_swim = True
        self.category = "Aquatic"

class Bird:
    def __init__(self):
        self.can_fly = True
        self.category = "Bird"
```
Certain zoo creatures, like a penguin, belong to more than one category (a bird that can swim). This is where we can use multiple inheritance as follows:

```python
class Penguin(Bird, Aquatic):
    def __init__(self):
        Bird.__init__(self)
        Aquatic.__init__(self)
```
The `Penguin` class inherits from both the `Bird` and `Aquatic` classes, giving it the properties of both. This creates a more realistic model of the penguin in our zoo application.

### Important Considerations

While multiple inheritance offers several benefits, keep in mind that it does increase the complexity of your code as well. Developers should tread carefully and only utilize multiple inheritance when it genuinely simplifies the design and doesn‚Äôt introduce ambiguity. And as always, with great power comes great responsibility.

Google‚Äôs Python class suggests, "For most Python use cases, it's recommended to use single inheritance versus multiple as it makes for simpler and more readable code."

That wraps up our brief tour of multiple inheritance in Python. üêç
