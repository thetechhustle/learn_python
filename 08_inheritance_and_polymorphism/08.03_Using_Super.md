### 08.03 Using Super: Mastering the Key to Cooperative Inheritance

In typical family situations, children communicate with their parents to get the information they need, be it life advice, a secret family recipe, or simply the WiFi password. In Python, the child classes (subclasses) also need a way to retrieve certain properties or methods from their parent classes (superclasses). That's where `super()` comes into play.

The `super()` built-in function in Python makes class inheritance more manageable and extensible. The function returns a temporary object of the superclass, which allows you to call its methods. The primary advantage of using `super()` is that it promotes code reusability and flexibility.

Letâ€™s illustrate this with practical code:

```python
class Mammal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def display_info(self):
        return f"This mammal's name is {self.name}"

class Dog(Mammal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed

    def display_info(self):
        return f"This dog's name is {self.name} and it's a {self.breed}"

buster = Dog("Buster", "Golden Retriever")
print(buster.display_info())
```

In the example above, we first define a `Mammal` class with a constructor (`__init__`) and a `display_info` method. Then we create a `Dog` class which inherits from the `Mammal` class. Inside the `Dog` class, we use `super()` function to call the parent classâ€™s `__init__` method. This lets us initialize the `name` attribute in the subclass `Dog` having to write it again. Hence, `super()` allows us to keep our code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Here's another illustrative example:

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length*self.width

class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, length):
        super().__init__(length, length)

mysquare = Square(5)
print(mysquare.area())
```

In this case, `Square` is a subclass of `Rectangle` and by calling `super().__init__(length, length)`, we're using the fact that a square is a special kind of rectangle.

That's the simplicity and maintainability `super()` introduces to your code. By calling the superclass's methods, the subclasses can inherit and override methods as needed, making inheritance management clean and straightforward. With `super()`, you've got the key to cooperative inheritance in your hands.

Next time you find yourself rewriting code within subclasses, remember `super()` is there to help your codebase remain DRY and maintainable. Remember that good code is more than just working code; it's reusable, flexible, and efficient.
