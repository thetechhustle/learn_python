## 08.01 Base Classes and Child Classes

Alright coder, it's time to take our first foray into the beautiful world of inheritance in Python. At its core, class inheritance is really all about two types of classes: base classes and child classes. Let’s get our heads around these terms. 🧠💡

### Base Class

A base class, also known as a parent or superclass, is a class that provides a certain functionality to the derived or child classes. In more straightforward terms, it's like the main blueprint that other classes can use and modify according to their requirements. 

Here's an example to set the ball rolling:

```python
class Animal:  # This is our base class
    def __init__(self, habitat):
        self.habitat = habitat

    def sound(self):
        print('I make sounds')

# Let's create an instance of Animal
elephant = Animal('forest')
elephant.sound()  # Output: I make sounds
```

In the above code, `Animal` is our base class. It has an initialization method and a `sound` method, simple and clear so far? Good! 🐾

### Child Class

Now, meet the child class. The child or derived class is a type of class that inherits the properties, methods, and fields of another class i.e., the parent or base class. Child classes are excellent time savers since they can borrow and tweak what the parent class offers, avoiding the need for repeated code.

```python
class Bird(Animal):  # This is our child class
    def __init__(self, habitat, type_of_bird):
        Animal.__init__(self, habitat)  # We call the parent constructor
        self.type_of_bird = type_of_bird  # This field is specific to Bird class

    def sound(self):  # Overriding the parent's method
        print('I chirp!')
        
# Let's create a Bird instance
sparrow = Bird('forest', 'sparrow')
sparrow.sound()  # Output: I chirp!
```

Notice how our `Bird` class utilizes the groundwork laid by the `Animal` class, yet customizes the behaviour to fit its unique requirements? This is the power of inheritance in action! 💥

Understanding the relationship between base classes and child classes is an integral part of learning Python, and as a new developer, you'd be using these concepts around the clock. So spend some time with these examples, tinker with them, change things around, and see how the pieces fit together.
