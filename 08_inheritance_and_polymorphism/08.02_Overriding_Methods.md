### 08.02 Overriding Methods

In your Python journey, there will be times when the child classes you create need to behave differently from their parent (base) class. Don't worry, Python has your back with a feature known as method overriding. Itâ€™s an integral aspect of inheritance, giving you the freedom to modify or enhance the functionality defined in the parent class. ðŸ”§ðŸ’«

Consider this: a base class `Vehicle` has a method `startEngine()`. Now, the way this engine starts could vary for different types of vehicles, say a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`. Instead of squeezing all variations into the parent method, you override this method in the child classes to suit their specific needs.

Here is a Pythonic example to help you visualize:

```python
class Vehicle:
    def startEngine(self):
        print("Generic vehicle engine started. Ready to go!")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def startEngine(self):
        print("Car engine roars to life. Buckle up!")

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    def startEngine(self):
        print("Motorcycle engine revs up high. Helmets on!")
```

The method `startEngine()` is overridden in both `Car` and `Motorcycle` child classes each providing a customized message. Let's go ahead and start the engines:

```python
car = Car()
car.startEngine()

motorcycle = Motorcycle()
motorcycle.startEngine()
```

Output:
```shell
Car engine roars to life. Buckle up!
Motorcycle engine revs up high. Helmets on!
```
And voila! ðŸŽ‰ Each child class expressed its unique variety of starting the engine.

Remember, when you override a method, Python does not call the parent class method unless explicitly told to do so. However, should the need arise where both parent and child method should be executed, use the `super()` function that you'll grasp in section 08.03.

Overriding methods in Python has a power effect. It frees you from rewriting the entire method from scratch, sidesteps code duplication, and makes your child class more adaptable and expressive. Itâ€™s like getting a ready-made cake (parent method) but then, you decide to add different layer toppings (child method) to make it even more delightful!

Thatâ€™s the charm of method overriding â€“ a simple yet effective vehicle (pun intendedðŸ˜‰) for customization. Now that you're armed with this, explore, experiment, and write code that caters to your specific needs. ðŸš€
