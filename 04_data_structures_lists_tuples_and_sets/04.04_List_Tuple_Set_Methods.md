## 04.04 List, Tuple, & Set Methods

In order to truly harness the power of Python's list, tuple, and set data structures, it is essential to familiarize yourself with various in-built methods that they come packaged with. Let's dive into some of these methods and see how they can make our programming lives easier. 😊

### List Methods
Here are some common List methods and how we can use them in Python.

**append()**: This method adds an item to the end of the list.
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.append('dorange')
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'dorange']
```

**extend()**: This method adds all the items in a list (passed as an argument) to the end of the current list.
```python
fruits1 = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits2 = ['orange', 'mango']
fruits1.extend(fruits2)
print(fruits1)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'mango']
```

**index()**: This method returns the index of the first element with the specified value.
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print(fruits.index('banana'))  # Output: 1
```

### Tuple Methods
Tuples might not have as many built-in methods as lists, but they still have some very useful ones.

**count()**: This method returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.
```python
numbers = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)
print(numbers.count(5))  # Output: 2
```

**index()**: Same as for lists, this method returns the index of the first element with the specified value.
```python
numbers = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)
print(numbers.index(8))  # Output: 3
```

### Set Methods
Last but certainly not least, we have the set methods.

**add()**: This method adds an element to the set. Remember that the set won't change if the item is already present in it; no duplicates allowed in sets! 😄
```python
tools = {'hammer', 'screwdriver', 'wrench'}
tools.add('drill')
print(tools)  # Output: {'drill', 'screwdriver', 'wrench', 'hammer'}
```

**remove()**: This method removes the specified element from the set. If the item does not exist in the set, it raises an error.
```python
tools = {'hammer', 'screwdriver', 'wrench', 'drill'}
tools.remove('drill')
print(tools)  # Output: {'screwdriver', 'wrench', 'hammer'}
```

**clear()**: This method removes all elements from the set, leaving you with an empty set.
```python
tools = {'hammer', 'screwdriver', 'wrench', 'drill'}
tools.clear()
print(tools)  # Output: set()
```

**union()**: This method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified set(s). If an item is present in more than one set, the result will contain only one appearance of this item.
```python
set1 = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)  # Output: {'a', 1, 2, 3, 'b', 'c'}
```

These were a few essential methods for your lists, tuples, and sets arsenal. They are just the tip of the iceberg, and there are loads more to discover and use. So keep exploring, keep coding, and keep building! Remember, practice makes perfect. 🛠️💻  

Always remember to choose a method keeping in mind the functionality you desire, and you'll find that manipulating data becomes not just easier, but a whole lot more fun! 💪🚀
