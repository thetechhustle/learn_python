### 09.04_Handling File Exceptions üëÅ‚Äçüó®‚ö†Ô∏è

File exceptions are a unique class of errors that are raised when there's an issue with the file we are working. It's an inevitable part of file handling in Python, much like a dragon guarding a treasure chest. But don't be frightened! Like all Python exceptions, these are not unmanageable, and with some knowledge and power, you can handle them deftly.

In Python, there are a few key types of file exceptions that may occur:

1. `FileNotFoundError` - As its name suggests, this type of error occurs when Python can't locate the file you're trying to access. 

   ```python
   try:
       with open('nonexistent_file.txt', 'r') as f:
           print(f.read())
   except FileNotFoundError:
       print("The file you are trying to access does not exist.")
   ```

2. `PermissionError` - This error arises when you try to open a file for writing when you only have read access or vice versa.

   ```python
   try:
       with open('read_only_file.txt', 'w') as f:
           f.write("Attempting to write.")
   except PermissionError:
       print("You do not have the necessary permissions to modify this file.")
   ```

3. `IsADirectoryError` - This error happens when you try to open a directory as a file.

   ```python
   try:
       with open('/home', 'r') as dir:
           print(dir.read())
   except IsADirectoryError:
       print("You are trying to open a directory, not a file.")
   ```

4. `OSError` - This is a general category of errors that includes the above exceptions and a group of other file-related exceptions.

   ```python
   try:
       with open('locked_file.txt', 'w') as f:
           f.write("Attempting to write into a locked file.")
   except OSError as err:
       print(f"OS error: {err}")
   ```

Remember, it's always better to expect and handle exceptions in Python. This way, your program can continue running smoothly, even when something unexpected occurs. 

In the next section, you'll learn about using Pickle to store data in a different manner, adding yet another tool to your Python file handling toolset. 

Now, go forth with your newfound power and conquer the dragons of exceptions üêâ‚öîÔ∏è.
