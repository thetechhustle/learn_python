## 14.02 Stacks and Queues 🛠️

### What's in a Stack? 🥞

A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure. Like a stack of pancakes, the last one you add (top of the stack) will be the first one you consume (removed from the stack). This is done by two primary operations: `push`, which adds elements to a stack, and `pop`, which removes the most recently added element. Let's see this in action:

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stackList = []

    def push(self, val):
        self.stackList.append(val)

    def pop(self):
        if self.stackList:
            return self.stackList.pop()
        return None

# Let's stack up some pancakes!
s = Stack()
s.push("Pancake 1")
s.push("Pancake 2")
s.push("Pancake 3")

# The last pancake in (i.e. Pancake 3), is the first one out!
print(s.pop())  # Output: Pancake 3
```

### Step Right Up with Queues 🎪

Unlike stacks, queues follow the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle. Imagine them like a lineup at a circus 🎪, the first person in line is the first person to enter the big top. Queues are operated with `enqueue` (adds element to the end of the queue) and `dequeue`, (removes the element at the start). Let's understand this better:

```python
from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = deque()

    def enqueue(self, val):
        self.queue.append(val)

    def dequeue(self):
        if len(self.queue) < 1:
            return None
        return self.queue.popleft()

# Queue up for the circus!
q = Queue()
q.enqueue("Person 1")
q.enqueue("Person 2")
q.enqueue("Person 3")

# The first person in the queue (i.e. Person 1) is the first one to enter.
print(q.dequeue())  # Outputs: Person 1
```

### Stacks vs Queues: The Throwdown 💪

Stacks and queues have contrasting conventions, but remember, neither is superior. They are tools, each with their use-cases and significance. It's all about picking the perfect tool for your task!

Explore them, practice with them, and experiment — you'll find their propensities and how they can catapult your code to new heights. Up next, you'll encounter frequently used coding patterns that leverage these data structures. Be ready to stack up your skills, as you unqueue the next chapter of your Python journey. Let the excitement enqueue as you delve further into the thrilling world of data structures! 🎆
