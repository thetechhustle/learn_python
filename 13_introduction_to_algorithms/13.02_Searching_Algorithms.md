### 13.02_Searching_Algorithms

Searching algorithms are exciting! 😄 These are the first tools you'll use to explore and interact with data. Just like finding a book in a library or a document on your computer, searching algorithms help you locate the data you need from a collection of information. But how do they work in the world of Python? Let's dive into learning two of the basic yet powerful search algorithms: **Linear Search** and **Binary Search**.

#### Linear Search 🔍

This is the simplest type of search algorithm, where you start at the beginning of the list and check each element one-by-one. Here's how you can implement it in Python:

```python
def linear_search(input_list, target_value):
    for index, value in enumerate(input_list):
        if value == target_value:
            return index
    return None

test_list = [1, 3, 9, 11, 15, 19, 29]
print(linear_search(test_list, 15))
```

In this code, `linear_search()` checks each element in the `input_list` until it encounters `target_value`, then returns the index. If it doesn't find the `target_value`, it returns `None`. It's straightforward and simple to implement 🎯, but inefficient for large lists because it might have to go through every single element.

#### Binary Search 🌓

A more efficient algorithm is binary search, but it requires your list to be sorted beforehand. It works by repeatedly dividing the list in half until it finds the target value.

```python
def binary_search(input_list, target_value):
    low = 0
    high = len(input_list) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if input_list[mid] == target_value:
            return mid
        elif input_list[mid] < target_value:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return None

test_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
print(binary_search(test_list, 11))
```

In the binary search, we begin by checking the middle value (`mid`). If it's not equal to `target_value`, then we know if the `target_value` lies in the lower half or higher half because the list is sorted. We repeatedly narrow down the range until we find the `target_value` or the range is empty.

Binary search is quick 🏎️, efficient, and an excellent example of a divide-and-conquer strategy! But remember: the trade-off is that it requires a sorted list.

As you can see, different searching algorithms offer their advantages depending on the situation. Mastering them can help you adeptly navigate through data, making your code more efficient and powerful. 

Next up, we'll uncover the sorting algorithms that often work hand-in-hand with search algorithms. Stay tuned and happy searching! 😊💻
