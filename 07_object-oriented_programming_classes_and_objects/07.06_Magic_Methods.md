## 07.06 Magic Methods

In this spellbinding section, your journey into the heart of Python continues. Here, you will unravel the mysteries and the powerful enchantments of Python's **Magic Methods**.

So, what are magic methods? üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Magic Methods, also known as Dunder (double underscore) Methods, are special methods that Python calls internally for certain operations when they are invoked using special syntax. They are the magical essence that makes your objects "Pythonic." 

Let's take a small dive into Magic Methods and see them in their full majesty ‚ú® .

### 07.06.1 `__init__` Method

Remember when we created our classes? Well, we already met our first Magic Method - the `__init__` method. This is the constructor method and it is called every time an object of the class is instantiated.

```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

fluffy = Cat('Fluffy')
```

In this code, when we create an instance of the `Cat` class named `fluffy`, Python automatically calls the `__init__` method to handle the initialization of the object.

### 07.06.2 `__str__` and `__repr__` Methods

Now, let's meet two new magical accomplices, the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods üé©. These methods are used to represent the object for end-users and developers respectively.

```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return f'A friendly cat named {self.name}'

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Cat({self.name})'

fluffy = Cat('Fluffy')
print(fluffy)  # Outputs: A friendly cat named Fluffy
print(repr(fluffy))  # Outputs: Cat(Fluffy)
```

When we print `fluffy`, Python calls the `__str__` method, and when we use `repr(fluffy)`, it calls the `__repr__` method.

These are just a few examples. Python contains a whole host of magic methods that can give your objects capabilities like arithmetic operations (`__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, etc.), comparison operations (`__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__eq__`, etc.), and much more.

In this section, we have just acquainted ourselves with the magic cloak that Python wears. With Magic Methods at your disposal, you can weave a spell of seamlessly Pythonic code. You are now no longer just coding in Python, you are writing the narrative of Python. In the next few sections, as your understanding of Magic Methods expands, so will your power to command the Python realm! üöÄ
