## 07.02 Creating a Class

A Python class is akin to a blueprint for an object. It employs the keyword `class` followed by the name of the class in CamelCase format (i.e., each word starts with a capital letter). ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember, the class definition must end with a colon(:).

Let's establish a simple class called `Spaceship`:

```python
class Spaceship:
    pass
```

In this scenario, `pass` is a placeholder. It indicates that this class currently doesn't do anything.

Next, let's enrich our *Spaceship* class with attributes. They are essential characteristics possessed by each instance of the class. Consider these attributes as variables within the class.

```python
class Spaceship:
    fuel = 100
    shielding = 50
    speed = 0
```

Every Spaceship object created from this class will begin with fuel of 100 units, 50% shields, and zero speed.

Creating an object from a class (also known as an instance) is as straightforward as calling a function. This object-creating function shares the same name as the class.

```python
enterprise = Spaceship() 
```

The `enterprise` object is an instance of the `Spaceship` class, complete with `fuel`, `shielding`, and `speed` attributes.

```python
print(enterprise.fuel)        # output: 100
print(enterprise.shielding)   # output: 50
print(enterprise.speed)       # output: 0
```

That's the glory of classes and objects: you can forge instances with their unique data üåü.

Now, onto the real craft. The class should do more than just hold attributes; it should also define actions (or methods). These methods are akin to functions tucked away inside a class.

```python
class Spaceship:
    fuel = 100
    shielding = 50
    speed = 0

    def launch(self):
        self.speed = 1000
        self.fuel -= 10
```

The `launch` method propels our spaceship into space, accelerating its speed to 1000 units/sec and consuming 10 units of fuel. Note the use of `self`. This is a reference to the instance of the object on which the method was called.

```python
enterprise = Spaceship() 
enterprise.launch()
```

Following the launch, the `enterprise` speed would be 1000 and the fuel would be reduced to 90. 

By mastering the creation of classes and their instances, you've taken a great stride on your Python journey! With this newfound power, you can craft code with the elegance of a skilled architect designing awe-inspiring structures. Remember, as with any new skill, practice is key. Tinker with classes, forge objects and let your creativity run wild in the Pythonverse. Onwards! üöÄ
